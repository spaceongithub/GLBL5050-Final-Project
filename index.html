    <h1>Welcome to My Final Python Project for GLBL 5050</h1>
    <p>This is where I share details about my project!</p>
    <h2>Title: Tracing Divergence: A Comparative Performance Analysis of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh based on Key UN SDGs</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>Motivation: During my time at UBC and Yale, I developed a deeper understanding of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, I realized that while growing up in India, SDGs rarely came to mind, leaving me curious about how India and its neighbors perform on these critical metrics. This project focuses on India, Pakistan, and Bangladeshâ€”countries that share deep historical, cultural, and social ties, having once been united under British rule. Using the World Bank Open Dataset, I aim to compare their progress on key SDGs by analyzing the Overall SDG Index Score and specific goals like No Poverty (SDG 1), Zero Hunger (SDG 2), and Good Health & Wellbeing (SDG 3). Additionally, the project seeks insights from various indicators such as Prevalence of Undernourishment (% of population) w.r.t SDG 2, Life Expectancy at Birth w.r.t SDG 3, etc. to understand the nuances of each country's development trajectory.</h3>
